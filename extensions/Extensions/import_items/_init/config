Package: import_items
Version: 2.3.0-2
Name: Inventory Items CSV Import
Description: This version supports importing Items, Sales Kits and BOM
 The fields used will be different depending upon what is being imported.
 It will still be a good idea to have a fixed number of (empty) fields to keep parsing simple.
 The first field is the record type and that will decide what the rest of the line means.
 More info you will find in readme.txt file found in extension install directory.
