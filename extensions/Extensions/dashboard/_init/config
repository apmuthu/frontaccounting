Package: dashboard
Version: 2.4.0-1
Name: Company Dashboard
Description: This module provides setup and support functions for the Dashboard theme. Both require each other to work.
 You need to install both the Dashboard module and Dashboard theme. The Dashboard theme changes each application main
 page into a dashboard displaying a number of widgets.
 Each widget can be configured separately for each user of the system. All users should be given 'Dashboard Setup'
 access so they can select which widgets are displayed on each page, and the information the widget contains.
 More info: see /modules/dashboard/readme.txt file.
